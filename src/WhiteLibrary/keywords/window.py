        """Attaches WhiteLibrary to a window.

        ``locator`` is the locator of the window or a window object.

        === Window locator syntax ===
        Syntax for a window locator is ``prefix:value``.

        When the locator syntax is used, the window is searched from the currently attached application.
        See `Attach Application By Id`, `Attach Application By Name` or
        `Launch application` for more details about attaching an application.

        The following window locators are available:
        | = Prefix =           | = Description =         |
        | title (or no prefix) | Search by the exact window title. If no prefix is given, the window is searched by title by default. |
        | id                   | Search by AutomationID. |
        | class_name           | Search by class name.   |

        Examples:
        | Attach Window | Main Window                   | # attach window with title         |
        | Attach Window | id:mainWindow                 | # attach window with Automation ID |
        | Attach Window | class_name:NavigationWindow   | # attach window with ClassName     |

        === Window objects ===
        A window can also be attached by directly passing the window object as the ``locator`` parameter value.
        This may be useful if the correct window cannot be found by using the window locator syntax.

        Example:
        | @{windows} | `Get Application Windows` | |
        | Attach Window | ${windows[1]} | # attach window at index 1 in window list |

        When using a window object as the ``locator`` parameter value, the window is attached even if it does not
        belong to the currently attached application.
        Note that when attaching a window that belongs to a different application than the currently attached one,
        attaching the window does not affect what application is attached to the library.
